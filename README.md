TARDIS Time's Tables
A Blue Peter style build that's as much simple arts and crafts as it is electronics. This is the TARDIS time's tables (rather than times tables). Use each Doctor's RFID card to solve multiplication sums and defeat the Daleks. This requires very little (or no) soldering, and all the parts are very common and cheap.
